anykey

this program monitors the
keyboard.

it shows the current state of
the keyboard.
---
keyboard

the keys are displayed in the
same layout as the physical
keyboard.

keys that are currently
pressed are displayed
inverted.

keys that were previously
pressed are displayed in
yellow. this helps detect dead
keys. to reset the state of
all keys to unpressed, hold 9
for two seconds.

special keys

all keys except for digits,
letters, space, caps and
symbol shift are read by the
computer as two key presses.

the computer can't tell if
such a key or the two
corresponding keys are
pressed, so anykey displays
all three as pressed.

for best results, test the
normal keys first.

technical limitations

if you press certain
combinations of three keys, a
fourth key will also appear
pressed. this is because the
three keys together create the
same electrical connection the
fourth key would.
