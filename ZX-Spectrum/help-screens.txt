anykey

this program monitors the
keyboard.

.if PLATFORM_48K or PLATFORM_PLUS
it shows the current state of
the keyboard.
.else
the upper window shows the
state of the keyboard.

the lower window shows the
state of joysticks connected
to the controller ports.
.endif

this is anykey ${VERSION}.
the newest version and further
information can be found at
   github.com/T-Pau/Anykey

keyboard

the keys are displayed in the
same layout as the physical
keyboard.

keys that are currently
pressed are displayed
inverted.

keys that were previously
pressed are displayed in
yellow. this helps detect dead
keys. to reset the state of
all keys to unpressed, hold 9
for two seconds.

.if PLATFORM_PLUS2 or PLATFORM_NEXT or PLATFORM_N_GO
joysticks

joysticks contain a stick or
d-pad with switches for the
four cardinal directions and a
fire button.

pressed directions and buttons
are displayed inverted.

.if PLATFORM_PLUS2
The +2 and +3 have two
joystick ports, Sinclair 1 and
2. Jostick movement is seen by
the computer as key presses.
Sinclair 1 uses the keys 6-0,
Sinclair 2 the keys 1-5.
.else
On Next and N-Go, the three
joysticks displayed are
Sinclair 1, Sinclair 2, and
Kempston.

Joysticks (continued)

For Sinclair 1 and 2 movement
is seen by the computer as key
presses. Sinclair 1 uses the
keys 6-0, Sinclair 2 the keys
1-5.

There are two joystick
physical ports. The user can
configure each of these as any
of the three joysticks.

Anykey doesn't know which are
in use, so it always displays
all three.
.endif
---
.endif
.if not PLATFORM_48K
special keys

all keys except for digits,
letters, space, enter, caps
shift and symbol shift are
read by the computer as two
key presses.

the computer can't tell if
such a key or the two
corresponding keys are
pressed, so anykey displays
all three as pressed.

for best results, test the
normal keys first.
---
.endif
technical limitations

if you press certain
combinations of three keys, a
fourth key will also appear
pressed. this is because the
three keys together create the
same electrical connection the
fourth key would.
