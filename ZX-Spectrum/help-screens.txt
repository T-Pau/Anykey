Anykey

This program monitors the keyboard.

.if PLATFORM_48K or PLATFORM_PLUS
It shows the current state of the keyboard.
.else
The upper window shows the state of the keyboard.

The lower window shows the state of joysticks connected to the controller ports.
.end

This is Anykey ${VERSION}.
The newest version and further
information can be found at
   github.com/T-Pau/Anykey

Keyboard

The keys are displayed in the same layout as the physical keyboard.

Keys that are currently pressed are displayed inverted.

Keys that were previously pressed are displayed in yellow. This helps detect dead keys. To reset the state of all keys to unpressed, hold 9 for two seconds.

.if PLATFORM_PLUS2 or PLATFORM_NEXT or PLATFORM_N_GO
Joysticks

Joysticks contain a stick or d-pad with switches for the four cardinal directions and a fire button.

Pressed directions and buttons are displayed inverted.

.if PLATFORM_PLUS2
The +2 and +3 have two joystick ports, which are seen by the computer as key presses. Joystick 1 uses the keys 6-0, Joystick 2 the keys 1-5.
.else
On Next and N-Go, the three joysticks displayed are Sinclair 1, Sinclair 2, and Kempston.
---
Joysticks (continued)

For Sinclair 1 and 2 movement is seen by the computer as key presses. Sinclair 1 uses the keys 6-0, Sinclair 2 the keys
1-5.

There are two joystick physical ports. The user can configure each of these as any of the three joysticks.

Anykey doesn't know which are in use, so it always displays all three.
.end

.end
.if not (PLATFORM_48K or PLATFORM_NEXT or PLATFORM_N_GO)
Special Keys

All keys except for digits, letters, space, enter, caps shift and symbol shift are read by the computer as two key presses.

The computer can't tell if such a key or the two corresponding keys are pressed, so anykey displays all three as pressed.

For best results, test the normal keys first.

.end
Technical Limitations

If you press certain combinations of three keys, a fourth key will also appear pressed. this is because the three keys together create the same electrical connection the fourth key would.
