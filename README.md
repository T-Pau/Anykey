# Building Joyride

Joyride is written in CC65 assembler. To build it, you need [cc65](https://cc65.github.io) and `make`.

The graphics are drawn in [Affinity Photo](https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/photo/) and converted with a custom, as yet unreleased, program and a [Python](https://www.python.org/) script. If you want to work on them, please contact me.
