It supports the following computers:

- Sinclair ZX Spectrum +2A (black model, made by Amstrad)
- Sinclair ZX Spectrum +3
- Sinclair ZX Spectrum Next
- N-Go (ZX Spectrum Next clone)

The upper window shows the state of the keyboard.

If the computer has controller ports, the lower window shows the state of connected joysticks.

To test other controller types or joystick adapters, please use the companion program [Joyride](https://github.com/T-Pau/Joyride) (currently only available on C64 and C128).
