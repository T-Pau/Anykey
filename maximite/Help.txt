Anykey
This program monitors the keyboard and
controllers.

The upper window shows the state of the
keyboard.

The lower windows shows the state of up to
three Wii controllers connected to the Nun 
ports.

Keyboard
The keys are displayed in the same layout as
the physical keyboard. Currently only the
US layout is supported.

Keys that are currently pressed are
displayed inverted.

Keys that were previously pressed are
diplayed in a lighter gray. This helps
detect dead keys. To reset the state of all
keys to unpressed, hold F11 for two seconds.

Technical Limitations
The Color Maximite 2 does not allow reading
keyboard scan codes directly. Instead it
translates the keys to their symbols. Since
some symbols can be entered via multiple
keys, Anykey does not know which of these
were pressed and displays all of them as
pressed.

This affects the Number Pad and some
letters in combination with Control.

At most six simultaneous key presses can be
tracked. Depending on the combination of
keys, it may be as few as three.

The Break key is reported as being released
immediately, so Anykey can't detect how
long it is being pressed and it only flashes
for a fraction of a second.
