your computer has.

displayed with a square frame. this
helps detect dead keys. to reset the
state of all keys to unpressed, hold
clr/home for two seconds.

technical limitations

if you press certain combinations of
three keys, a fourth key will also
appear pressed. this is because the
three keys together create the same
electrical connection the fourth key
would.
