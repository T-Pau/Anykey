Keyboard

The keys are displayed in the same layout as the physical keyboard. It automatically detects which keyboard your computer has.

.if COLS_40
Pressed keys are displayed inverted.
.else
Keys that are currently pressed are displayed inverted.
.end

Keys that were previously pressed are displayed with a square frame. This helps detect dead keys. To reset the state of all keys to unpressed, hold Clr/Home for two seconds.

Key Labels

Technical Limitations

If you press certain combinations of three keys, a fourth key will also appear pressed. This is because the three keys together create the same electrical connection the fourth key would.
