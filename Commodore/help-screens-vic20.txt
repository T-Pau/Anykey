anykey

this program monitors keyboard and joystick.

this is anykey ${VERSION}. the newest version and further information can be found at

 https://github.com/
   T-Pau/Anykey
---
windows

the upper window shows the state of the keyboard.

the lower window shows the state of the joystick connected to the controller port.
---
keyboard

the keys are displayed in the same layout as the physical keyboard.

keys that are currently pressed are displayed inverted. previously pressed keys are displayed in green. this helps detect dead keys. to reset the state of all keys, hold f5 for two seconds.
---
joystick

joysticks contain a stick or d-pad with switches for the 4 directions and up to 3 buttons.

pressed directions and buttons are displayed inverted.

buttons 2 and 3 bring an analog potentiometer to a low value by connecting its pin to +5v.
---
Key Labels

Most keys are labeled with the symbol they produce when pressed without shift. Special keys are labeled with a short description or graphics symbol:

    Clear/Home: Ⓔ
     Commodore: Ⓚ
       Control: Ⓖ
   Cursor -
    Left/Right: Ⓝ
       Up/Down: Ⓜ
 Insert/Delete: Ⓕ

Key Labels

Most keys are labeled with the symbol they produce when pressed without shift. Special keys are labeled with a short description or graphics symbol:

     Restore: Ⓗ
      Return: RET
    Run/Stop: Ⓘ
       Shift: Ⓛ
  Shift Lock: Ⓙ
---
special keys

shift lock and left shift appear as the same key to the computer and cannot be reliably distinguished on all computers.

the restore key cannot be read directly. anykey can detect when the key is pressed, but it can't detect for how long.
---
technical limitation

joystick interferes with reading the keyboard. when it is pressed, certain keys can't be read. these keys will be ignored while the joystick is pressed. auto fire might defeat this detection and result in phantom key presses.
---
technical limitation

if you press certain combinations of 3 keys, a 4th key will also appear pressed. this is because the 3 keys together create the same electrical connection the 4th key would.
