anykey

this program monitors the keyboard and
joysticks.

the upper window shows the state of
the keyboard.

the lower window shows the state of
two joysticks connected to the
controller ports.

this is anykey ${VERSION}. the newest
version and further information can be
found at
   https://github.com/T-Pau/Anykey
---
keyboard

the keys are displayed in the same
layout as the physical keyboard.

keys that are currently pressed are
displayed inverted.

keys that were previously pressed are
displayed in a lighter gray. this
helps detect dead keys. to reset the
state of all keys to unpressed, hold
.if __PLUS4__
f3 for two seconds.
.else if __MEGA65__
f13 for two seconds.
.else
f5 for two seconds.
.endif
---
joysticks

joysticks contain a stick or d-pad
with switches for the four cardinal
.if __PLUS4__
directions and one button.
.else
directions and up to three buttons.
.endif

pressed directions and buttons are
displayed inverted.
.if not __PLUS4__

buttons 2 and 3 bring an analog
potentiometer to a low value by
connecting its pin to +5v.
.endif
.if __C64__ or __C128__

to test other controller types or
joystick adapters, please use the
companion program joyride which can be
found at:
  https://github.com/t-pau/joyride

special keys

.if USE_VICII
shift lock and the left shift key
appear as the same key to the computer
and cannot be reliably distinguished
on all computers.

the restore key cannot be read
directly. anykey can detect when the
key is pressed, but it can't detect
for how long.
.else
shift lock, left shift and right shift
appear as the same key to the computer
and cannot be reliably distinguished
on all computers.  the same is true
for the two control keys.
.endif
.if __C64__ or __MEGA65__

on mega65, when pressing cursor up or
left, right shift and the opposite
cursor keys also appear pressed. to
avoid prematurely marking keys as
pressed, these keys are disabled in
that case.
.endif

.if __C64__
---
commodore 128

when run in c64 mode on a c128, anykey
will display and test the full c128
keyboard.

the 40/80 display key cannot be read
in c64 mode, therefore it is displayed
grayed out. to test it, use the native
version, anykey 128.
.endif
---
technical limitations

.if USE_VICII
joysticks interfere with reading the
keyboard. when a joystick is pressed,
certain keys can't be read. these keys
will be ignored while the joystick is
pressed. if such a key was pressed
before the joystick, it will remain
pressed until the joystick is
released. auto fire might defeat this
detection and result in phantom key
presses.

.endif
if you press certain combinations of
three keys, a fourth key will also
appear pressed. this is because the
three keys together create the same
electrical connection the fourth key
would.
