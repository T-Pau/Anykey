Anykey

This program monitors the keyboard and joysticks.

The upper window shows the state of the keyboard.

The lower window shows the state of two joysticks connected to the controller ports.

This is anykey ${VERSION}. The newest version and further information can be found at
   https://github.com/T-Pau/Anykey
---
Keyboard

The keys are displayed in the same layout as the physical keyboard.

Keys that are currently pressed are displayed inverted.

Keys that were previously pressed are
displayed in a lighter gray. This
helps detect dead keys. To reset the
state of all keys to unpressed, hold
.if PLUS4
f3 for two seconds.
.else if MEGA65
f13 for two seconds.
.else
f5 for two seconds.
.end
---
Joysticks

Joysticks contain a stick or d-pad
with switches for the four cardinal
.if PLUS4
directions and one button.
.else
directions and up to three buttons.
.end

pressed directions and buttons are
displayed inverted.
.if not PLUS4

Buttons 2 and 3 bring an analog potentiometer to a low value by connecting its pin to +5v.

These potentiometers are also used by paddles and the 1351 mouse; if such a device is connected, the buttons may read as pressed.

Joyride

To test other controller types or joystick adapters, please use the companion program joyride which can be found at
  https://github.com/t-pau/joyride

Special Keys

.if USE_VICII or MEGA65 or VIC20
Shift Lock and the left Shift key appear as the same key to the computer and cannot be reliably distinguished on all computers.

The Restore key cannot be read directly. Anykey can detect when the key is pressed, but it can't detect for how long.
.else
Shift Lock, left Shift and right Shift appear as the same key to the computer and cannot be reliably distinguished on all computers.  The same is true
for the two Control keys.
.end
.if C64 or MEGA65

On MEGA65, when pressing cursor up or left, right Shift and the opposite cursor keys also appear pressed. To avoid prematurely marking keys as
pressed, these keys are ignored in that case.
.end

.if C64
---
Commodore 128

When run in C64 mode on a C128, Anykey will display and test the full C128 keyboard.

The 40/80 Display key cannot be read in C64 mode, therefore it is displayed grayed out. To test it, use the native version, Anykey 128.
.end
---
Technical Limitations

.if USE_VICII
Joysticks interfere with reading the keyboard. When a joystick is pressed, certain keys can't be read. These keys will be ignored while the joystick is
pressed. If such a key was pressed before the joystick, it will remain pressed until the joystick is released.

.end
If you press certain combinations of three keys, a fourth key will also appear pressed. This is because the three keys together create the same electrical connection the fourth key would.
