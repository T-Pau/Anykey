## Loading the Program

Insert the tape and enter `LOAD ""` by pressing `J` and `Symbol-P` twice. Then press `Enter` and the play button on the tape deck.


## The Keyboard Window

The keys are displayed in the same layout as the physical keyboard.

Keys that are currently pressed are displayed inverted.

Keys that were previously pressed are displayed in yellow. This helps detect dead keys. To reset the state of all keys to unpressed, hold `9` for two seconds.


## The Joysticks Window

Joysticks contain a stick or d-pad with switches for the four cardinal directions and a button.

Pressed directions and buttons are displayed inverted.

Joystick movement is seen by the computer as key presses. Joystick 1 uses the keys 6-0, joystick 2 the keys 1-5.

## Technical Limitations

If you press certain combinations of three keys, a fourth key will also appear pressed. This is because the three keys together create the same electrical connection the fourth key would.
